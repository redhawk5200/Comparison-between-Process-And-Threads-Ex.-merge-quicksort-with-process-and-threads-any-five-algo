## Comparison between Process And Threads using Mergesort, Selectionsort, Insertionsort and Bubblesort
# Project for the course: Operating System CS2006

<p>
  Project I did for the course "Operating System" with my classmates. The goal is to differentiate between the Process and Threads using various sorting alogrithms
  mentioned above. We also drew their graphs using matplotlib of python by recording the time of all the sorting alogorithms on process and threads, and the graphs of threads
  showed us that threads took way less time.
